**Today's Progress**: Worked on building a minesweeper app as part of the Codecademy course I'm taking

**Thoughts:** This took me longer than the other stages of making the minesweeper game so far. I was working on it yesterday and ended up deleting the entire file this afternoon and starting over.  Going through the steps was much easier this time, but I'm still frustrated that until I read the steps I can't think of what they would be.

### Day 1: January 2, 2018  

**Today's Progress**: Took notes about control flows, built a magic 8 ball app and an app that tells racers their start time based on their age the time they registered. 

**Thoughts:** Thought this was much easier than yesterday-- I've used if else statements a lot in the past so the class part of today was pretty easy, although I didn't know about switch statements which seem very useful.
