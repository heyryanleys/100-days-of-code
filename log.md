**Today's Progress**: Worked on building a minesweeper app as part of the Codecademy course I'm taking

**Thoughts:** This took me longer than the other stages of making the minesweeper game so far. I was working on it yesterday and ended up deleting the entire file this afternoon and starting over.  Going through the steps was much easier this time, but I'm still frustrated that until I read the steps I can't think of what they would be.
